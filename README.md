# Material 3 Theme for Home Asistant: C11, Purple

## What is it
A Material 3 based extended Dark & Light theme for Home Assistant.

This theme not only defines Material 3 dark and light mode colors, but also adapts some of the Home Assistant colors in dark mode as advised by Material 3:
- The error, warning, success and info colors
- The energy dashboard colors
- The label badge (red, blue, green, yellow, grey) colors
- The state climate colors
- The state (on, off, home, not home, unknown, idle) colors

All these colors have been desaturated a bit and given more brightness to have a better match with the dark mode.

The theme also defines some Neumorphic shadow colors for dark and light mode.

For beta documentation: see https://ha-m3-themes.docs.amoebelabs.com/
